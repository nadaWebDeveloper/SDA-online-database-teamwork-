# ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) Assignment 

## Assignment Overview

For team assignment, only 1 member in the team should fork the repo. Then, the admin can invite other members to contribute in the same repo. Remember to have develop branch before merging to main.
In this assignment, you will create an ERD for either an E-commerce system or a Library system of your choice. Your ERD should represent the essential entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. 
 
**Submission Guidelines**: Attach screenshot of your ERD diagram. 

## Level 1: Basic Requirements

**Identify Entities**: For your chosen project, identify the main entities that need to be stored in the database. These could include customers, products, orders, books, authors, category, etc.

**Define Attributes**: For each entity, list and define the attributes or properties associated with it. For example, for a "customer" entity, attributes might include "id," "firstName," "lastName," "email" and so on.

## Level 2: Additional Requirements

**Establish Relationships**: Determine the relationships between entities. Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. For instance, in an E-commerce system, a "customer" may have multiple "orders". 

**Key**: When establishing relationships, remember to create a legend or key in your ERD to explain the notation used for relationships.
